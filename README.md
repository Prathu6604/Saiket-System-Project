# Saiket-System-Project
This repository contains the projects developed during my Java Developer Internship at SaiKet Systems. These tasks focus on Core Java principles, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and building efficient console-based logic.
I have successfully completed the following Java applications, focusing on clean code, user-friendly console interfaces, and robust error handling.

1. To-Do List Application
A console-based task management tool that allows users to organize their daily activities.

Key Features: Add, view, remove, and mark tasks as completed.

Tech used: ArrayList, Input Validation, Scanner.

2. Temperature Converter
An utility tool for quick thermal unit conversions.

Key Features: Supports Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin conversions.

Tech used: Mathematical logic implementation and conditional branching.

3. Calculator Application
A functional arithmetic calculator designed for precision.

Key Features: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with error handling for "division by zero."

Tech used: Switch-case statements and Exception Handling.

4. Number Guessing Game
An interactive game that challenges the user to guess a randomly generated number within a specific range.

Key Features: Score tracking, limited attempts, and "high/low" feedback.

Tech used: java.util.Random, While loops.

5. Text File Analyzer
A powerful console tool that processes text data.

Key Features: Counts words, characters, and lines within a .txt file.

Tech used: File I/O (FileReader, BufferedReader), Stream API.

 Technical Skills Acquired
Language: Java (JDK 8+)

Core Concepts: OOPs, Collections Framework, Exception Handling, File Handling.

Tools: VS Code / IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse, Git.
